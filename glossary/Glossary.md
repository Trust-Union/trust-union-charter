# Glossary

This glossary defines core terms used across Trust Union.
Keep entries **short and stable**. If a term needs deeper rationale, examples, or extended patterns,
create a dedicated file in this folder and link it from here (e.g., `./requirements.md`).

## Collaboration (evidence-based)
In Trust Union, collaboration means **continuous improvement** (Kaizen) with mutual **validation**:
proposals evolve through issues and pull requests, using Git for revision-safe history, review, and traceability.
Open-source commitment supports **global interoperability** and **freedom from vendor lock-in**.

**Related:** Git-based workflow, Neutral Zone, Open-source commitment.

---

## Digital Public Infrastructures
Digital Public Infrastructures are **publicly relevant digital foundations** that enable trusted services at scale—
especially in regulated environments and ecosystems funded with public money.
Examples (illustrative, not exhaustive): identity and wallet ecosystems, regulatory sandboxes, cross-border platforms,
critical registries, and sector-wide interoperability infrastructures.

**Note:** Examples reflect relevant large-scale initiatives; the glossary stays sector-agnostic.

## Kerckhoff’s Principle
A security system must remain secure even if everything about it is public—except the secret keys.
For Trust Union, this translates to **transparency, traceability, and verifiability by design**:
if a property cannot be independently validated, it cannot become a standard.

---

## Requirements (auditable requirements)
A requirement is an **explicit, testable, and traceable statement of intent and constraints** for a digital artifact.
Auditable requirements are written so that independent reviewers can:
- understand the goal and rationale,
- verify acceptance criteria,
- reproduce evidence through checks, tests, or documented procedures.

**Related chain:** Requirements → Acceptance Criteria → Automation → Verifiable Security Properties.

---

## Security-by-Design
Security-by-design means security properties are **defined upfront** and remain **verifiable throughout the lifecycle**.
Every digital artifact starts with **validated, non-contradictory requirements** bound to acceptance criteria.
Security becomes actionable only when it is **explicit, testable, and traceable**.

**Related:** Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Evidence.
