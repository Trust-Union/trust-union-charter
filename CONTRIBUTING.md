# Contributing
Join in and help shape Trust Union 🤝✨ Together we define clear, testable requirements, digital artifacts and verification patterns that scale across organisations, sectors and nations — neutral, transparent, and evidence-driven.

## How we work
- Open an Issue for proposals and problem statements.
- You are welcome to **fork** or **clone the repository**, **apply changes**, and **contribute** them **via a Pull Request** with a clear rationale.
- Use **Pull Requests for any changes** to any artifacts.
- Use **Pull Requests for new contributions** either new artifacts or improvements to existing documents, templates or any improvement to existing content.
- Keep your contribution **evidence-driven**: add references, examples, and verification ideas.


## Review & Merge (Minimal Principle)
- Every contribution is reviewed and merged by **someone other than the author**.
- For high-impact or uncertain changes, reviewers may invite **additional reviewers** to reach a well-founded decision.


## Definition of Done (for proposals)
A proposal is ready when it includes:
1) Goal  
2) Rationale  
3) Acceptance criteria  
4) Verification approach (how to test / validate)


## Neutrality
No vendor-specific dependencies and no national framing as default.
Domain-specific adaptations are welcome, but must be derived from the EU-level core.

Jump in and directly use your Pull Requests for your impact! Your contribution — either new artifacts or any improvement to existing content are very welcome. Open a PR and join the work! 🙌🤝
